 # Automated Resume Relevance Check System 

## üìÑ Problem Statement

At Innomatics Research Labs, resume evaluation is currently **manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming**. Every week, the placement team across Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, and Delhi NCR receives 18‚Äì20 job requirements, with each posting attracting thousands of applications.  
Currently, recruiters and mentors manually review resumes, matching them against job descriptions (JD). This leads to:  
- Delays in shortlisting candidates.  
- Inconsistent judgments, as evaluators may interpret role requirements differently.  
- High workload for placement staff, reducing their ability to focus on interview prep and student guidance.  

With hiring companies expecting fast and high-quality shortlists, there is a **pressing need for an automated system** that can scale, be consistent, and provide actionable feedback to students.  

**This project automates the process to:**  
- Evaluate resume relevance to a job description.  
- Highlight matched and missing skills.  
- Provide actionable improvement suggestions.  
- Track analysis history with statistics and top candidates.

  - Verdict
- Returns results as **JSON** to the frontend.

### Workflow
1. User uploads a resume and job description via the Streamlit frontend.
